## Game planning

- _Use GET to retrieve the dice size choice from the form and store the choice in a variable_
- _Create an array for the user and an array for the computer with a name key and a roll key in each array_
- _Depending on the dice size choice, create an array for the dice that ranges from 1 to the selected number of sides_
- _Randomly choose one of the dice array values and assign it to each of the players_
- _Compare the assigned values and match the highest value to the winning player_
- _Report the winner_
